		<h1>About LoL Data Rocket project</h1>
		<div style="justify-content: center; margin: auto; width: 80%; margin-top: 40px;">
			<p>
				The main aim of the project was to find the best performing champions in given matchups or just lanes overall (as well as statistically prove that Nasus support is viable).
				All the data comes from the <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/apis">Riot API service</a>, amounting to the total of 1 162 572 games downloaded across seasons 10-12, yet
				for this analysis only 799 888 classic games from season 12 are used.

		<h2>Data collecting</h2>
		<div style="justify-content: center; margin: auto; width: 80%; margin-top: 10px;">
			<p>
				Most of the data collecting infrastructure has been set up on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS Cloud Services</a>, as shown on the diagram below.

				In order to extract the data from the matches, first we need to get ids of those matches. Since the project started on a small scale, I had used a couple of python script that crawled through
				the players and their matches obtaining sizeable numbers of player ids as well as match ids. Those match ids were enough to download meaningful amounts of data. However, as downloading 
				match data is more exhausting for the API (because the limits are strict) and therefore to personal computers, cloud-based computing became a much more efficient solution. AWS lambda function is tasked with getting the match ids
				using Riot-X-Token as an authenticator and then store the data in the S3 bucket. To easily provide match ids for the lambda, Simple Queue Service (SQS) was created where match ids 
				in packets of 100 match ids per message were queued. Another SQS held the Riot-X-Tokens which proved to be more efficient than including the token directly, as SQS allows for better
				scalability - each Riot-X-Token in the queue triggers a new lambda function. After all the match data is stored in S3, Athena and AWS Glue have been used to extract only the necessary 
				information from those matches and download it for the analysis.
